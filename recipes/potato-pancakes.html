    <h3>Final Product of the Potato Pancakes</h3>
    <p>This is another classic dish from many countries of Europe! Consisting mostly of grated potatoes, it's best served with sour cream.</p>
    
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 large potatoes</li>
        <li>1 yellow onion</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat the oven to low, about 200 degrees F (95 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Finely grate potatoes and onion into a large bowl. Drain off any excess liquid.</li>
        <li>Mix in egg, salt, and pepper. Add enough flour to make the mixture thick, about 2 to 4 tablespoons all together.</li>
        <li>Heat 1/4 inch oil in the bottom of a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Drop two or three 1/4-cup mounds of batter into hot oil, and flatten with back of a spatula to make 1/2-inch-thick pancakes.</li>
        <li>Fry, turning pancakes once, until golden brown. Transfer pancakes to a plate lined with a paper towel to drain. Keep warm in the oven until serving. Repeat until all potato mixture is used.</li>
        <li>Serve warm, enjoy!
